# AVIF
Test images for AVIF, compressed by various tools.

[AVIF is a new format](https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4) to get the smallest (possibly) lossy images.  Unsure about lossless.

You can visit/star/clone all the test images [repos at GitHub](https://github.com/test-images).

## History

Latest files are in **[202105](./202105/202105.md)**.  Only ðŸ‘‰[squoosh\lossless7](202105\squoosh\losssless7) has content ATM.

## License

MIT, though art, photos, website screenshots are (c) of their respective creators.  I tried to use "Free for commertial use" for 3rd party artistic content.  Website screenshots are in 'fair use' due to the nature of this testing (small snipit in context).
I may have used only a portion of 3rd party files, so do not expect clones.

Please see the source files' [repo at test-images/png](https://test-images.github.io/png/) for detailed author & copyright information.
